Linux Shell Scripting

Let start with what we know,

We have a raspberry pi board (SoC), which is a hardware Soc
This hardware has Kernel to make use of the SoC, else the purpose having a SoC board doesn't serve.
To use Hardware, we communicate with Kernel, but at the same time to communicate with Kernel we need a shell which is on top of the kernel

What is this Shell again?, say I have an application basic like a calculator this application communicates with the shell and then passes on to the kernel to make best use of the resources available from the hardware which is nothing but a Raspberry Pi board.

Now imagine a Linux System, where we have hardware, inside which we have Kernel along with File systems and Device Drivers. In this Kernel stage, kernel manages the hardware resources for the rest of the system.

Next as explained earlier we have Shell, What will shell do is that it interprets the user commands, which is also responsible for finding the commands and starting their execution. Several different shells are available among which bash is the most popular shell.

Now above the shell we know that we have user applications, like user commands which includes executable programs and scripts.

Why do you think user commands, shell, kernel and hardware is required.

user commands is the commands that we can easily remember to perform some action
shell is command line interpreter which acts a translator to kernel

***************************************************

Shells:
Now using the above information it is clear that it acts a platform that provides interface between user and an Operating System. Even shell is C code program.


There are many types of shells present in the industry:
	1. C shell - It has features like aliases and and command history.
			csh

			default prompt for bourne shell is % for root user

			tcsh - is the advanced version of csh, with additional features such as command history, filename completion and fancier prompts
	2. Bourne Shell - This was also developed by AT&T labs. Original UNIX shell, faster nd more preferred. default shell for solaris OS
			sh
			default prompt for bourne shell is $(ro #) for root user
	3. Korn Shell - developed by AT&T, superset of Bourne shell, faster than C shell and also compatible with the same. It has built-in arithmetic and C-like arrays, functions and string manipulations
			ksh
	4. GNU Bourne Again Shell - it includes features from bourne and korn
			bash
	5. T shell - 
			tsh
	6. Z Shell - this is extended version of bash
			zsh 


	NOTE 1 : How to check which shell is used
				echo $shell
					here, shell is a environment variable, path is also environment variable, $ is value of the variable. echo is the shell command to print the message on terminal.
	NOTE 2 : How many shells are present
				cat/etc/shells
					this will give above all shells explained



Now that you have understood what shell is, where it resides and what is it's functionality, let's know more about the SHELL SCRIPT

Shell script is a file containing a sequence of commands, which have variables and flow control statements like any other programming languages, that facilitates the repeated execution without having to be retyped n number of times.

Two method to execute Shell Script:
1 ./hello.sh requires executuion permission
2 . hello.sh doesn't require execution permission

Activity 1: Display helloworld! on terminal using shell scripting

echo "helloworld!"

Activity 2: Display helloworld! on terminal using shell scripting
a = 10;
echo $a

NOTE: comments in shell is followed by #

Every sucessful shell script gives Zero as return output, wheras unsuccessfull gives non zero number


** If else using shell scripting **

syntax:

if [ &v1 option $v2]

then

else

fi

Key points:
-lt : lesser than
-gt : greater than
-eq : equal to
-le : lesser than equal to
-ge : greater than equal to
